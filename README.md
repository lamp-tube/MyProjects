Problem Statement
You have been given a dataset of customer orders from an online store. The data is in a
CSV file `orders.csv` with the following columns:

- order_date: date when the order was placed
- product_id: unique identifier for each product
- product_name: name of the product
- product_price: price of the product
- quantity: quantity of the product ordered
  
Your task is to write a Python program that reads the data from the CSV file and performs
the following tasks:
- Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset.
