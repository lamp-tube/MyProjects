Problem Statement
You have been given a dataset of customer orders from an online store. The data is in a
CSV file `orders.csv` with the following columns:
- order_id: unique identifier for each order
- customer_id: unique identifier for each customer
- order_date: date when the order was placed
- product_id: unique identifier for each product
- product_name: name of the product
- product_price: price of the product
- quantity: quantity of the product ordered
  
Your task is to write a Python program that reads the data from the CSV file and performs
the following tasks:
- Compute the total revenue generated by the online store for each month in the dataset.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each product in the dataset.
- Compute the total revenue generated by each customer in the dataset.
- Identify the top 10 customers by revenue generated.

2. at line number 13, pass the desired .csv file
3. save the task.py file
4. execute python script using command [python task.py]

** SOL=2
<-- steps to run docker file
1. create the docker image
docker build -t project_app_image .
2. now run the image, it will create container with name: project_app_container, by default it will run on orders.csv file
docker run --name project_app_container project_app_image
